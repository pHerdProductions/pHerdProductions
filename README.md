- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! My name is Ralph, also known as "pHerd" (music) and "Your Local Geek" (local Charleston, SC tech solutions).
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in the ever decreasing space between human and technology, and how we can use it to our advantage while minimizing the downfalls.
- ðŸ’™ I love utilizing STEM/programming in the artistic realm, no matter what sense it attributes to. Most of my favorite sonic and visual artists are digital nerds like myself. The possibilities are ever expanding, and the outcomes are never shy of inspiring.
